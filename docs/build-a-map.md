# Building a map with Mapzen terrain tiles

You can use Mapzenâ€™s terrain tiles with a variety of browser-based rendering software packages. Following the syntax of the library you are using, you need to specify the URL to the Mapzen terrain tile service, the layers that you want to draw on the map, and styling information about how to draw the features.

## Tangram

[Tangram](https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram) is a WebGL browser based mapping engine and supports native iOS and Android rendering with OpenGL in 2D and 3D from vector and raster tiles.

## GDAL

GDAL allows Desktop analytics, hill shading, and contouring.

The [collect.py](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/examples/collect.py) script in the examples downloads and collects GeoTIFF tiles within a bounding box and map zoom into a local directory and optionally merges them into one big file.

### GDAL examples:

Download tiles into a named local directory:

`python collect.py --bounds 37.8434, -122.3193, 37.7517, -122.0927 --zoom 12 directory/path/`

If the output filename ends in `.tif`, `.tiff`, or `.geotiff`, **gdal_merge.py** will be called to merge all downloaded tiles into a single image.

`python collect.py --bounds 37.8434, -122.3193, 37.7517, -122.0927 --zoom 12  directory/path/merged_filename.tif`

Once you have that big file, you could run [gdaldem hillshade](http://www.gdal.org/gdaldem.html#gdaldem_hillshade) to generate a basic hillshade. Mapbox has a great [tutorial](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/terrain-data/#creating-hillshades) with full set of options.

## QGIS

Visualize the merged GeoTIFF image (see examples above) and perform analysis functions including generating contour lines and hillshades in QGIS, the free and open source GIS app.
